Hunker
=========

This is a hunker that modify the makefile and apply our patches to it.

Why is it called hunker
========================

You can see in dkms modules that sometimes "hunks" are being applied to it.
These are small patches that update the code. We use the same terminology and so
I decided to call the utility which does it hunker. I don't really know
what does it mean, neither if it's english word.

What it exactly does
======================

Install and uninstall options as well as some other options in makefile.

How do I use it
================

You don't need to, this is internal tool for use on linux installers, this
has no use for other OS
