This document describes how the review process is done

Because github currently doesn't support any form of
a code review, the review is being done as comment to
commit.

The review has following form:

  REVIEW: +N
  OPTIONAL comment

for example:

  REVIEW: +1
  Change is OK but may need to require some extra work

Explanation of numbers:

+2 - edit is OK, keep it
+1 - edit is OK, but it may require some additional work
-1 - edit is not OK, it needs to be discussed or improved
-2 - edit needs to be reverted, critical BUG introduced

Every commit should be reviewed by at least 1 programmer
